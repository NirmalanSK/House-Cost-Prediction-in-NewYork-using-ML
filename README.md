# üè† House Cost Prediction in New York

##  Project Overview

This project predicts **house/apartment costs in New York** using **Machine Learning**. The dataset contains property details such as location, size, and amenities. By applying regression models, we estimate the price of houses and evaluate the model performance.

##  Dataset

* **File**: `apartment_cost_list.csv`
* Contains housing information including features such as:

  * Location
  * Number of bedrooms
  * Number of bathrooms
  * Size (sq. ft.)
  * Additional amenities
  * Price (target variable)

##  Technologies Used

* **Python** 
* **Pandas, NumPy** ‚Üí Data cleaning & preprocessing
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** ‚Üí Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** ‚Üí Machine learning models

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Checked for missing values
* Distribution plots & correlation heatmap
* Outlier detection

##  Machine Learning Models

Implemented and compared:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* AdaBoost

##  Results

* Evaluated models using metrics such as:

  * **R¬≤ Score**
  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
* Identified the best-performing model for house price prediction

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House-Cost-Prediction-in-NewYork.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd House-Cost-Prediction-in-NewYork
   ```
3. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook House-Cost-Prediction-in-NewYork.ipynb
   ```

##  Future Improvements

* Add hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
* Try deep learning models (Neural Networks)
* Build a web app using **Streamlit / Flask** for live predictions
